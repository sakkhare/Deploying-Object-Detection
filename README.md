I recently trained an object detection model using Roboflow 3.0 to accurately detect eggs, achieving the following results:

Mean Average Precision (mAP): 75.0%
Precision: 63.5%
Recall: 79.8%
This model was developed as part of my ongoing work in computer vision, focusing on enhancing accuracy and efficiency in detecting objects. The process involved:

Annotating and preparing a dataset of 102 images.
Training the model with the COCOn checkpoint for optimal performance.
Fine-tuning the model to balance precision and recall effectively.
